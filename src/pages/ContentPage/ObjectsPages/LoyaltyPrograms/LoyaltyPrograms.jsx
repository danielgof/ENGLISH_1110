            The number of loyalty programs among customers has grown among companies. This is all because these types of the program turned out to be extremely profitable for companies which provide them to their customers. But such high demand among customers was caused because these types of programs also help clients of the company gain profit from using the company’s product. One good example of such a program is “Starbucks Rewards”. This program offers additional bonuses for customers who attend “Starbucks” regularly in form of free products. The bonuses can vary from client status. The idea of that program is the following: by purchasing Starbucks a customer can earn specific points that can be later applied to receive the company’s products for free. Depending on how many points (they are called stars) are received might be provided different options. More stars mean a better choice of products to get for free. It is worth mentioning that for the customer to receive points for a purchase he or she must be registered with a Starbucks account. The statuses vary depending on purchases that are made, so the more client is purchasing more they can benefit from the company and its products. This policy helps the company attract new customers and thus grow as a business and benefit customers as well. This is a good example of a harmonic policy that provides benefits for both customer and seller. Additionally, this business strategy of mutual benefits also helps Starbucks maintain profitable business across the world. However, one might suggest that this is beneficial only for customers who are purchasing Starbucks’s products regularly. But we should remember that this specific advertisement is aimed at regular customers. In the end, Starbucks Rewards seems to be a nice choice for those who are fans of coffee or Starbucks’s products specifically.
