          Bundling Products is a good campaign, provided by many companies. That usually benefits mutually, because it helps customer to get rid of electronics or any other different kind of product and receive benefits from it from company. And company in its turn going to receive valuable resources that can be extracted and reused in other products. That approach will benefit everyone as company will receive product that can be reused in many ways such as disassembled into pieces and add those pieces to other companyâ€™s projects and etc.
