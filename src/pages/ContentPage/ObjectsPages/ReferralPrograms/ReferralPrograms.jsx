          A good example of mutually beneficial advertisement is Referral Programs. Referral Programs in a nutshell are programs that provide benefits to those clients who share information about a company. Benefits that can be received by clients usually depend on the program’s conditions. The main idea of referral programs is to provide clients who share information about the company’s products or services with additional benefits. For instance, additional bonuses to the phone plan, etc. Usually, it is a very useful program for a client that helps to get bonuses to clients. In other words, referral programs are very useful in most cases. Referral Programs are meant to provide bonuses for things that can be done by clients, meaning sharing information about the company and its products. This is why referral programs can be called one of the most beneficial programs for clients. A good example of such a program is - Dropbox Referral Program. Dropbox offers its users extra space in cloud storage for sharing information about Dropbox with others. To confirm that the user shared info about Dropbox, new users must be registered directly through the link provided by a user who is already a client of the company and shared a link from a personal account. Only then the fact of providing information about the company can be confirmed and only that kind of sharing provides clients with bonuses from the company. Overall, referral programs can be a win-win situation for both companies and their customers. Companies can acquire new customers at a lower cost than traditional advertising, while customers can receive benefits for sharing their positive experiences with their friends and family.
