          Discounts are a good example of advertisement along with other examples. The advertisements that are telling customers about discounts provide customers with ways they can benefit from purchasing a companyâ€™s products or services. This might allow a customer to get the most profitable deal on the market and the company in its turn has a chance to attract new clients. Discounts are a great way for customers for purchasing a desired product for a lower price. There are different types of discounts but the most common one is that provide customers with the opportunity to purchase goods that could not give a company that much profit. This can be the selling of clothes of not up-to-date collections or electronics that are dated or food that is about to expire and should be consumed in a short period. In most case scenarios discounts seem to be not an obvious choice, but clients must understand that this is an opportunity for them to save money as well as for the company to get profitable. The main difference between discount days and discounts that are provided on regular bases is that sales during discount days are provided for a majority of products and discounts are usually significantly lower. That is making to attract new customers and get rid of useless products. 
          An example of such an advertisement can be Amazon Prime Day. This is the time when a company offers discounts on a variety of products, so many people can benefit when purchasing from Amazon. Discount on a particular product usually varies on demand for a particular product, but there are still other factors that can play a role in it. So, in any case, both customer and seller can benefit from discounts and this seems to be a good example of advertisement. To conclude, discount days are a good example of an advertisement that can be trusted.
