          There are numerous types of advertisements nowadays. Some of them took place online, some of them can be found on the billboards on the streets others are placed on the walls. But no matter what format the advert has, we still witness it in large amounts.

However, among many fraudulent advertisements, there are good ones. These kinds of advertisements benefit both client and seller, in other words, they are meant to tell about goods or services not to fool a client. Good example is Loyalty Programs and Referral Programs. For instance, ‘Starbucks Rewards’ allows one to get extra production for no payment or ‘Dropbox Referral Program’ that is allowed one to get extra storage on account by sharing information about Dropbox. In addition to loyalty and referral programs, bundling products, and free trials, there are other types of beneficial advertisements as well. For instance, bundling programs can help customers by getting rid of useless things and benefiting from them. The company, that receives products back receive plenty of opportunities along with that. Old products can be disassembled into parts and used as details at repair centres or if we talk about metal parts they can be melted down and used in new products.

          Another type of beneficial advertisement is one that offers a trial or a sample of the product or service. This can help the customer make an informed decision about whether the product or service is worth the investment. For example, a skincare company might offer a sample of its moisturizer, allowing the customer to try it out before committing to purchasing a full-sized product. In addition to these types of advertisements, customers need to be aware of certain red flags that may indicate a fraudulent advertisement. For example, an advertisement that promises unrealistic results or offers a product or service at an unreasonably low price should be approached with caution. It is important to do research and read reviews before making a purchase, especially if the advertisement seems too good to be true.
